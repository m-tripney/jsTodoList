# Todo List

## An exercise in DOM manipulation

This JavaScript Todo list was an exericse in working with the DOM. It's rough-and-ready right now, and will be refactored â€” the logic for button manipulation is untidy, albeit effective, and should be made more coherent. I intend to move these processes into functions.

Further, I intend to add local storage to make it more useful.
